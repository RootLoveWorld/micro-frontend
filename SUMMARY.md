# Micro-Frontend Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a micro-frontend architecture using Qiankun with the following components:

1. **Base Application**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (port 3000)
2. **Sub-applications**:
   - Vue 2 + TypeScript + Vite (port 3002)
   - Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite (port 3003)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Monorepo Structure
- Restructured the project into a monorepo with `apps/` and `packages/` directories
- Configured pnpm workspaces for managing dependencies across multiple packages

### 2. Base Application (React)
- Created a new React 18 application with TypeScript and Vite
- Integrated Qiankun micro-frontend framework
- Configured micro-frontend registration for Vue applications
- Added container elements for mounting sub-applications

### 3. Vue 2 Sub-application
- Created a Vue 2 application with TypeScript and Vite
- Implemented Qiankun lifecycle methods (bootstrap, mount, unmount)
- Configured Vite for micro-frontend deployment

### 4. Vue 3 Sub-application
- Created a Vue 3 application with TypeScript and Vite
- Implemented Qiankun lifecycle methods (bootstrap, mount, unmount)
- Configured Vite for micro-frontend deployment

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start all applications:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Access the applications:
   - Main application: http://localhost:3000
   - Vue 2 app will be loaded at `/vue2` route
   - Vue 3 app will be loaded at `/vue3` route

## Key Features

- **Independent Development**: Each application can be developed and tested independently
- **Runtime Integration**: Applications are integrated at runtime using Qiankun
- **Technology Agnostic**: Supports different frontend frameworks (React, Vue) in a single page
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new sub-applications

## Next Steps

1. Add routing between applications
2. Implement shared component library
3. Add state management across applications
4. Configure production deployment
5. Add error boundaries and loading states
